<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are a registered non-governmental organisation with the aim to serving the body of Christ (children, teens and adults) in spiritual literacy and total development.
<p>On 8th February 2012, we received Eden Networking Transfiguration (ENT) Ministry with the mandate to transmit life to people spiritually and educationally which will infuence every other aspect of their lives. We commenced ministry on 18th August, 2018 with house-to-house publicity of Children's Bible Club since most neighbours were yet to read our posters.</p>
<p>We had our first Bible Club on 25th August, 2018 with six wonderful children (David, Judith, Glory, Grace, Korede and Benjamin) with our first lesson "The Trinity".</p>
