<h1>WILDERNESS POEM</h1>
<p>
Walking as Jesus walked<br />
Step by step as led<br />
Not with doubt but by faith<br />
Reaching the other side of the journey
</p>
<p>
Thinking as Jesus thought<br />
Dwelling on the word of God<br />
Meditating day and night<br />
Visioning the great joy ahead
</p>
<p>
Talking as Jesus talked<br />
Discerning the spirit of men<br />
Exposing the devices of the heart<br />
Declaring the wondrous works of God
</p>
<p>
Acting as Jesus acted<br />
In a sinful world yet without sin<br />
With a script directed by God's Spirit<br />
Producing the best movie-Jesus film
</p>
<p>
Crying as Jesus cried<br />
Touched by the infirmity of others<br />
Compassion expressed at its peak<br />
Eternal life given at mercy seat
</p>
<p>
Tempted as Jesus was<br />
By spirits and mortal beings<br />
All round tried as humanity<br />
Victorious by the Holy Spirit
</p>
<p>
Struggling as Jesus struggled<br />
The will of God not an easy task<br />
Trusting in God the easy yoke<br />
Going to Heaven in glorious robe
</p>

<h1>MENTORING</h1>
Mentoring is a three-worded word<br />
Mentoring is  men-to-ring<br />
There is no mentoring without "Men"<br />
Neither is there mentoring without "To"<br />
Nor will there be mentoring without "Ring"
</p>
<p>
You need men in your life journey<br />
Men are people who will guide and lead you<br />
People who will inspire you with their experiences<br />
People who have been through what you are passing through<br />
There is no mentoring without "Men"
</p>
<p>
Where are you heading with these men?<br />
What is your goal being around them?<br />
There must be a focus for this relationship<br />
They are there to take you somewhere better<br />
There is no mentoring without "To"
</p>
<p>
Like a ring that encircles everything<br />
It must touch all aspects of your life<br />
From the spiritual to the physical<br />
All round inspiration for a balanced life<br />
There is no mentoring without "Ring"
</p>
